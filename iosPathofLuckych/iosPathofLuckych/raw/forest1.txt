I continue walking through the forest.
It looks like the way out of the forest!
In joy, I jump out of the forest.
However, I was wrong.
Looks like I found a lawn in the middle of the woods.
Quite a beautiful place.
Flowers grow everywhere, birds sing.
When I go out, I notice interesting plants.
Where I lived, this herb was medicinal.
I rip a little.

Suddenly I notice a snake among the grass. And 2 more behind her.
This is very bad!
With all legs I run into the forest. It just ruined my mood.
However, at least he collected herbs. Looks like I can live a little longer.
