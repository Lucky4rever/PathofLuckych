I continue walking through the forest.
What a strange place!
The trees below have almost no leaves.
The whole earth is in some kind of pits of a strange shape.
As soon as I thought about it, I noticed a tree nearby, all scratched by giant claws.
It looks like there is something dangerous.
I begin to carefully hide away to the side.
Suddenly I hear a terrible roar, similar to a bear.
It's bad, it looks like he noticed me!
I start running at full speed. Let me just be lucky, and he does not chase me!
Having run a decent distance, I find myself in front of a ravine. Climbing inside, somewhere in the distance I hear roar. Looks like I ran away.
After that, I continued on my way, looking back along the way. I do not know what else I will meet in this forest.
