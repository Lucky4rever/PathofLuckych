I continue walking through the forest.
I wonder how big it is?
No matter how many times I go, it never ends.
Every time I am amazed at its size.
I see a rise ahead. I wonder if you can see this place from above?
Then I got the idea to cure on a tree.
However, they are too high. And I can't climb trees either.
You have to at least try.
I'm trying to get out.
It looks like I was lucky, because this tree is quite branched, and it is quite easy to climb it.
It looks like this tree has no top. No matter how much I climb, I still can't reach the top.
I accidentally looked around.
Horror, I'm only in the middle, and already at a great height from the ground! If I climb up, how am I going to get down then?!
It's too dangerous, you have to go down. However, what, I climbed in vain?
I try to look around, but I understand that the trees block the entire view anyway. Unlucky.
Little by little, slowly going down.
It looks like I can still go down, but I'm still afraid to fall.
But it seems that this time I was lucky, and I calmly went down. Probably not worth the risk anymore. However, I will not get ahead of myself.
After that, I continued on my way. I wonder what will happen next?
