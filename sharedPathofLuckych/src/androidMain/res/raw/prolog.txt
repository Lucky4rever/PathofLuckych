Weird feeling.
This is the end?
I do not feel anything. My eyes are closed, my body seems to be made of stone.
Only my consciousness shows that I still exist.
How did it happen? How did I get into this state?
Feeling like I've always been here. Or never?
How long has it been since I got here? Day? Year? Or maybe even a second?
What is time anyway? A system that contributes to the perception of space? Then what is space?
Looks like I'm going a little crazy.
I need to get out of here, but how?
...
...
...
Little by little my mind is fading.
I don't know what to do and there is no way to know.
Is it the end now?
At this thought, I finally open my eyes...
