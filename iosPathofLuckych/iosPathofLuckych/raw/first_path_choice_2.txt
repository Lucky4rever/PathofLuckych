What I saw surprised me to say the least.
It was clearly not Earth. There is no place on Earth where the sky is purple.
The forest surrounded me. The trees looked like pines except that they were broad-leaved.
This whole forest was strange enough, and densely planted enough that you couldn't see through it.
Because of this, and the rather uneven terrain, it was possible to estimate the size of the forest. And there was no end to it.
I was at a small cave. The cave was at the foot of massive, strangely shaped stone mountains. These mountains were incredibly high, and their angle was over 45Â°. I don't think I'll be able to get out at all.
In addition, this mountain range is also very long. But what if you go along it?
Looking around, I decide where to go next.
I think it would be best to go along the mountains.
Still, this mountain range is very long, which means that at the end there must be some kind of road or path along which these mountains are bypassed.
In any case, I hope so.
I hope I can find people here.
Having decided on the route, I set off. I don't know what will be waiting for me, but I need to get out of this secluded place.
This is where my story begins...
