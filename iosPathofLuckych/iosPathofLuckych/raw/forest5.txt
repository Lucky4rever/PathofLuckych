I continue walking through the forest.
What a strange place!
The trees below have almost no leaves.
The whole earth is in some kind of pits of a strange shape.
As soon as I thought about it, I noticed a tree nearby, all scratched by giant claws.
It looks like there is something dangerous.
I begin to carefully hide away to the side.
Suddenly I hear a terrible roar, similar to a bear.
It's bad, it looks like he noticed me!
I understand that I hesitated, and it will not work to run away. Looks like we have to fight...

After that, I continued on my way. I do not know what else I will meet in this forest.
