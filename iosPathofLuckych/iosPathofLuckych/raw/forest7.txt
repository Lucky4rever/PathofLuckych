I continue walking through the forest.
I wonder how big it is?
No matter how many times I go, it never ends.
Every time I am amazed at its size.
I see a rise ahead. I wonder if you can see this place from above?
Then I got the idea to cure on a tree.
However, they are too high. And I can't climb trees either.
Okay, anyway, I'm somewhere very far from the exit from the forest. No need to waste time on this.
After that, I continued on my way. I wonder what will happen next?
