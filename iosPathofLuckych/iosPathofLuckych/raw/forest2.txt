I continue walking through the forest.
What a strange place!
The trees below have almost no leaves.
The whole earth is in some kind of pits of a strange shape.
As soon as I thought about it, I noticed a tree nearby, all scratched by giant claws.
It looks like there is something dangerous.
I begin to carefully hide away to the side.
Suddenly I hear a terrible roar, similar to a bear.
It's bad, it looks like he noticed me!
Need to think! Why is there so little vegetation here? Looks like this creature is omnivorous!
Fortunately, I have some healing herbs.
I throw it on the ground where I am standing and start running.
After running a little, I look back.
It looks like the monster acts as I expected. Where I was before, there is now a gigantic bear-like creature eating something.
Without stopping, I keep running. This time my ingenuity saved me.
After that, I continued on my way, looking back along the way. I do not know what else I will meet in this forest.
