I continue walking through the forest.
What a strange place!
The trees below have almost no leaves.
The whole earth is in some kind of pits of a strange shape.
As soon as I thought about it, I noticed a tree nearby, all scratched by giant claws.
It looks like there is something dangerous.
No, I don't want to take another chance, I'll go the other way.
After that, I continued on my way, looking back along the way. I do not know what else I will meet in this forest.
