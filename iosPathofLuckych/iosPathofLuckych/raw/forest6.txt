I continue walking through the forest.
It looks like the forest is thickening. I hope I'm not walking in the opposite direction to the exit?
If you think about it, this forest is changing all the time. I wonder if I can get out?
It looks like it's already so thick that I'm tripping over twigs and grass.
On the other side, thorny branches get under my clothes and scratch my skin.
It looks like I went into the "thorny" grove.
This thought make me laugh, but the pain makes me want to cry.
I don't know how far I've come, but I obviously don't want to go back.

How long have I been walking.
However, it looks like there is a way out ahead. One last push left!
Aaaaaand...
Finally, I got out of this hell. I hope I never go to a place like this again.
